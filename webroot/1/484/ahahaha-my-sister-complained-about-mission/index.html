	<div class="content">6th February 2004<br><br>
Dear Sir or Madam:<br><br>
I had the displeasure of visiting your establishment ‘Mission’ last night (05/02/04), with work colleagues on a staff outing.  Having been a frequent visitor over the last few years I felt confident, that in inviting my friends and colleagues (many of whom are new to Swindon) to your club we would have a stress-free and enjoyable night.<br><br>
Unfortunately this was far from the case.  As a customer of yours, one of the primary things I expect is that the toilets will not only be well stocked with all necessities, (toilet paper, soap etc) but that they will be found in a sanitary and inoffensive manner.  I was completely and utterly disgusted and found myself embarrassed and ashamed to have put my colleagues through such an experience.  In the ladies toilet after 11 o’clock, human excrement was both visible and disgustingly on the floor of the restroom.  I do not think that it is too much to ask for that when one visits the toilets such messes be, at least in the process of being cleaned up.  The very fact that the mess remained there for the entire night is proof enough that not a single toilet check by a member of staff was made between the time of my arrival (just after 11) to the time of the club closing. If a check was made then I have to say I find your standards of hygiene highly questionable!  <br><br>
Something else I do not appreciate, are dirty condoms strewn over the floor. As I walked down the stairs near to the toilets this is what I found! I do not judge people by actions such as these, but I will judge an establishment, which refuses to instigate the simplest of procedures to ensure distasteful sights and potential health risks, such as this are banished from public areas. Especially as the average age of your patrons seems to be under 18!!<br><br>
One point which stuck in my throat was that as I arrived at Mission your bouncers were turning away a boy for wearing trainers, obviously you have your rules and I respect that, he was breaking the rules so he was denied entry. However, I would like to point out that there is such a think as a minimum drinking age. One worrying sight that caused me embarrassment was that the average age of the person inside Mission last night seemed to be no older that 16, perhaps 17 at a push.  I would not normally complain about such matters but when at 23 I felt like one of the eldest in the club and I feared for my personal safety and that of my friends amongst drunken teenagers I feel it is my right to complain.<br><br>
The standard of the toilets primarily really was not acceptable and some sort of toilet check system as is commonplace in other establishments (the proof is the state as you visit) needs to be implemented before the place turns into something inhabitable even for the filthiest animal. I would also advise shampooing the carpets as they appeared to be covered in a mixture of stale and fresh vomit and alcohol, the smell really is unbearable!  <br><br><br>
I had invited my colleagues out last night as a person who has lived in Swindon all my life, to show them a good time.  What we ended up with was an embarrassment to me, an embarrassment to Mission and ultimately to the town in which I live.  Old town is an up and coming area for young professionals and I do not believe that we need an establishment which brings down the tone to such a level. As I have said before I have had many memorable nights within Mission and have taken friends before and had very good nights.  The last few times I have visited the standards appear to have been falling and that is quite hard to accept for one who cares a great deal about the state of the club for sentimental reasons.  I felt as a valued customer that I should write to you and inform you of my concerns, on the basis that if I decide to visit Mission again that hopefully things will have changed.<br><br>
Please be assured that I will be writing to the local paper as well as contacting the police regarding the underage drinking.<br><br><br>
I look forward to hearing your response.<br><br>
Kind regards<br><br><br><br>

It's worrying because she hasn't exaggerated at all. The carpet is STINK and the toilets are bad. Although I've never seen condoms on the floor there, it's probably because I've never beenl looking hard enough.<br><br>
2-1 odds she doesn't get a response.<br><br>

drunk blokes on occasion dont always hit the target, but do people in mission intentionally aim for the floor?!?!? am I missing something??!?!(no pun intended)<br><br>
GRIM!<br><br>
with regards to the age thing, im seeing a worrying trend.......alot of younger kids seem to be gettin into Po Na Na, they seem to be less strict with their door policy at the moment. Hopefully thats just a temporary thing due to the slump in the number of people going out at the begining of the year.<br><br>

How can anyone WANT a club to raise its prices? That's like being pro-higher tax; nonsense. Study after study has shown that people are happiest when they have money. Money does make you happy. Therefore, cheap clubs = more money = happiness. The problem isn't that young people can afford it, it's that they can get in. I know when I was young, we went to places that let us in as a first priority; we weren't too bothered about the prices.<br><br>

Examples are Kaos/Route 66 - D&amp;D, Cairos - Eros, Vadims - Soda etc!<br><br>
This could be the final nail in the coffin for Mission!  Mind you - they'll still keep on going as they'll have the business from their younger customers fro now, but I don't think it will be long before the young uns start trying to go to Poo's etc.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->
