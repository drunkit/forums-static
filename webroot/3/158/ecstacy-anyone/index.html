it made for a good night.  People on ecstacy are a lot nicer than drunk people, they cause no trouble, and they aren't being antisocial like smokers of any variety.  I understand that ecstacy is quite bad for your brain, but its gotta beat the ass of Alcohol for preventing people becoming assholes.  Nobody had even the smallest thought of violence.<br><br>

	<div class="content">Straight to the point, statistically the death figures attributed to alcohol immensely dwarf those given for ecstacy.<br><br>
However, drugs shouldn't just be seen as posing an immediate risk, there is also a great unknown potential long term risks.  Not forgetting that alcohol also has its fair share of long-term risks.<br><br>
Fair enough, talking about come downs is all good. But, we've all been hungover.  Hang-over, Come-down....very different but also the same!<br><br>
In all fairness i think the appropriate body needs to start doing some propper research into ecstacy.  You cant stop people taking it, so educate them into taking it safely.  <br><br>
We've now got all these health warnings on cigarette packets, but why are bottles of booze not labled in the same manner?  After-all incidences of alcohol related disease and illness are increasing dramatically!<br><br>
Plus its not all doom and gloom, there is one drug that may have a potential health benefit!  Only time will tell. One word - reclassification!<br><br>
I'm not condoning the use of drugs!<br><br>

Long-term effects of Ecstasy use include additional psychological disturbances that are often irreversible even when the drug use is stopped. Several of the short-term effects, if severe enough, can also lead to sudden death. Ecstasy, even in small doses, can lead to sudden death due to its effect on the heart.<br><br>

Fishing is clearly far more hazardous than I though, and not just for the fish...<br>
It's thought that some ecstacy deaths were PMA not MDMA (similar and sold as ecatacy, but more dangerous) but I can't personally understand the appeal of either. <br><br>
They used to (and still!) give some scary things to OAPs. Budgie seed also used to contain marijuana. Now we know why the damn things sing all the time...</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

From what I've read, the main ingredient of ecstacy is either MDMA or MDA.  well, that mixed with god knows what.....dont forget these pills are made in illegal undergroud drugs labs...<br><br>
lets not loose sight of why people take ecstacy...because of the 'positive' affects!  from what ive read about it, 'E' makes you: happy, talkative, loved up, friendly, sociable, helps you relax, make you want to dance, lowers your inhibitions, raises libido, and the cost. £3 for a pill and you're sorted all night, where as if you were out drinking it'd cost you a fortune in comparison!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

That entire website seems to be clouded in right wing hearsay.  there is no evidence to back up the claims that pills are getting stronger. Certain instituations that have a vested interest in the safety of ecstacy users have observed a significant decrease in the strenght of ecstacy tablets in the last decade.<br><br>
Easier availability: the notion to me of easily available ecstacy is completely absurd.<br><br>

Too right. That was in December... three months later and here it is.<br><br>
The way I see it is that drugs aren't more common, they're just more topical. The more people priss about things, the better the media makes of it. Drugs are bad, but it's just as likely that more deaths are attributed to them; rather than more deaths being caused by them. The real source of drug problems is the crime associated with it. Dealers and so on are a massive cause of violence in clubs, as well as general every-day crime.<br><br>

Some people may know that I took 1 and a half pills once. And yes, it was without a doubt the best night of my life. In my opinion, spending a night being as happy as larry and having fun is nothing to be ashamed of. I don't have a habit of it but if somebody offered me an E I wouldn't dismiss it. I would consider where I am, who I am with and what alcohol i have drank before taking it. <br><br>
What Lenehan says about the comedown is laughable! I felt.... tired and slightly weird. Although I was up till 6:00am so thats understandable. As opposed to when I was drunk as a skunk and had to be carried home, I was sick in the spare room, woke up in my pants in the kitchen then spent the whole day being sick and feeling much pain. <br><br>
I would never recomend or offer people drugs because its up to the person if they want to do it.<br><br>
I just find it strange how people are happy to get so drunk they can't remember anything but look down on takers of E. <br><br>

	<div class="content">Im with Hot_Dog on this one, and i understand his/her reasons for wanting to remain anonymous.  I've no idea who Hot_Dog is, but it has encouraged me to post my experience of chemicals.<br><br>
Mikes' view of 'chemical happiness' is rather banal and ill informed. Im not criticising those that take that opinion, but thats how you would categorise E at its most basic level; It is a chemical; It makes you high.  To those who have experimented, it is 'chemical happiness' yet so very much more! It has nothing to do with the individual not being able to be happy within themselves.  Those Drunkiteers that know me, can easily see the fact im an incredibly happy person.  But everyone has bad times!<br><br>
Why do people take E? You drink to have a good night - people take E to have an amazing night!<br><br>
But the bottom line remains.  I've had the best nights of my life on chemicals! Life is all about experiences. E for me has opened the door to some amazing experiences and thoughts! True, it causes a slight break from reality, but ask yourself - is that a bad thing? We all day dream! If thats not a break from reality - what is?<br><br>
Im not a regular user of E as i respect the fact it has very powerful effects on the brain, but it makes a welcome change to getting drunk.  Say, special occasions.  Taking E is not as simple as going out and getting drunk.  You cant just drop a pill anywhere.  It has alot to do with where you're going, who you're with and how you're feeling.  You'll see that people that take E tend to be very responsible and mature about it. Like with everything though, you get a few twats that go OTT!<br><br>
I also entierly agree with what Hot-Dog said about comedowns. Like with drinking, you dont dont always get hungover. You don't always have a comedown on pills! Comedown's make you feel spaced for a day, but no more than like you've missed a nights sleep - which you probably have!  Personally I dont mind comedown's - i think they're quite amusing! Hangovers don't make me laugh!<br><br>
I wanted to post my view so that there would be some actual first hand experiences(along with Hot_dogs') of the subject matter - not just speculation!<br><br>

	<div class="content">I think hot_dog and frank have made some fair points and I'll openly admit that my view on it all is probably very uneducated because I have never taken any kind of drugs in my life - not even smoked a spliff!<br><br>
The discussions I've always had before with people that have 'experimented' always comes down to health related issues and they point out that I drink and it damages your liver, which I then argue back with - that's only if you drink all the time and I only drink in moderation.  Which then gets the comeback that you are alright taking E occasionally.  Fair enough I suppose!<br><br>
But don't you worry about something happening to you???  I could never try anything like that because I would be so scared that something dodgy was in it.  I know most people would use the same 'reputable as safe' dealer, but what if for some reason something went wrong??  What if their dealer gave them something dodgy??<br><br>
That doesn't happen with alcohol.<br><br>
Also what about addictions? Obviously you can become an alcoholic which causes the obvious problems, but if you've had such an amazing night on E and with no bad comedown, surely that makes you want to do it more???  Having a really minging hangover from drinking can make you be more careful in the future, but if E has given you such a fantastic night you are going to start thinking 'well this is pretty good!'.<br><br>
Also people who use E regularly are going to start having to take more to get the same affect and maybe move on to more harsher stuff - cocaine being one of them and like frank said, let's not get started on that!<br><br>
Well that's just my opinion anyway - I'm sure most people who take it are responsible about it but I could never do it because I'd worry that something would go wrong or that I'd like it too much.  I just don't like the idea of pumping my body with these chemicals and there being a risk of something dodgy in it.  There's no wrong or right in this - just people who do and people who don't.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

That is the risk. But its not a very big risk so its nothing to worry about. You just have to be cautious. I knew the person I did it with very well and he had a big batch of the same thing. E's come stamped with little symbols so you know what kind you are taking. You can also look them on the internet to see what they are and if there are any bad reports of them. I'll agree though, I was scared as soon as I had done it. <br><br>
Surely this is the same risk that someone could spike your drink though?<br><br><br>
With regards to the addiction thing... E is not addictive. People can become mentally dependant on it (i.e. "Oooh I can't have a good night without a pill") but it is not possible to become physically addicted. Oh and you definately wouldn't want to do more E on a comedown. I'd say a pillow and an X-Box would be more your kind of thing  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" width="15" height="15" alt="8)" title="Cool"> .<br><br>

	<div class="content">wow! some interesting stuff on here!<br><br>
My first thought is there are very differing views on E! The Right wing view tends to be, if you do a pill it WILL kill you and you'll be a waster all your life(ok abit extreme but you get the idea)! The users point of view seems to be, it isn't as unsafe as the media make out and it makes for some fantastic times....i mean, who are you supposed to belive?<br><br>
Being scared is a natural human reaction. when i first started drinking i used to get a little bit scared.<br>
I would assume dealers look upon selling their pills as a business.  What would be the point in having somethingin them that would make people very ill?  The only result would be the dealer having a batch they couldn't sell....not good for business!<br>
Dealers may give you dodgy pills but large companies ocassionally stuff up and bottle poisons instead of alcohol by accident.  This happened only last year!<br><br>
As Matt said it is fairly obvious who hot_dog and frank are! especially to those that have the amazing power and understanding of the Protocol of the Internet!  That and you could always look at their profile for their name and address</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It can not be said that it is similar to having a drink spiked, as this would require you to actually give someone the opportunity to do this, pills will be dodgy without you having any blame for it.<br><br>
I may be against these drugs but its only because ive seen the effects of long term use, and i suppose it can be similar to long term alcohol abuse in the way it affects your life but being more common there is at least more knowledge and help for alcohol.

I don't agree this is the same though.  You willingly put a pill in your mouth and swallow it - having your drink spiked is being given the drug against your own will and without you knowing about it.<br><br>
To be honest I never hear of peoples drinks being spiked with E or anything else these days and I can't understand why a user would want to waste their pills doing such a thing - I don't know how much they cost, £7 a pill maybe???  That is a complete guess as I have no idea!<br><br>
A lot of it now is girls having their drinks spiked with the date-rape drug Rophlynol (if that's how you spell it!) - where the victim is drugged and raped and can't do a thing about it or remember a thing about it.  The attackers are now even using this drug with a steriliser meant for cattle and horses in it so that their identity cannot be identified from any traces of semen left in the body.  This sterilisation is permanent meaning the victim will never be able to conceive.  It's a scary thought and it certainly makes me very wary of my drink.  <br><br>
Sorry - that was going off the subject a little!<br><br>
Alex, I hear what you are saying about who to believe.  There are very mixed opinions - you have all the media hype about it which I generally believe is to influence the younger generations into not starting up on it - and you have the people who use it who say it is safer than made out.<br><br>
The problem is you get one case i.e. Leah Betts took 1 pill and died and the whole thing is blown out of proportion.  The thing that's always made me wonder is maybe Leah Betts was a regular user and just happened to have a dodgy pill one night?  Who knows?? Her parents are going to say she wasn't a druggie - of course they are!<br><br>
I'm not condoning the use of drugs as I myself don't agree with it - I think it is illegal for a reason.  You can never stop anyone from taking one - they have the right to do what they want, but all the government etc. can do is accept that people do and are going to take drugs and ensure that they are well educated about it and know how to be safe.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I just think you would become more dependant on drugs because you would want to do that more than drink because you have a better time.<br><br>
Also I think the people in the drugs industry are more clued up than you think.  If I was going to be a dealer I wouldn't want to sell my goods to just anybody - for all I know they could be a police 'mole' or something and if something went wrong and one of my customers ended up in hospital, I wouldn't know about it and you could wake up to the police on your doorstep.  Obviously it all has to be very 'hush hush', but I think there are intelligent people behind it all.  Quite scary!<br><br>
Nowadays I think users are very sensible about where they get it from and how they go about doing it.  I think the old hype about 'rat poison' being put in etc.  isn't as common as it used to be- dealers have got to much to risk - i.e. their freedom - to risk selly dodgy pills.<br><br>
I'd still be scared to take one though!!<br><br>
It's when it gets to the long term affects and being mentally dependant that problems occur - people get desperate because they want to have that hit again and they feel like they can't have a good time or being their 'real' self without it.<br><br>
I have seen a few cases with long term affects - they're all on cocaine now - plus I know of people who have gone to prison because of the crimes they have committed to fuel their habit.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Although girls should be being careful with their drinks anyway because of royhpnol anyway!<br><br>
You would never know if it had been put in your drink and it would be so easy for someone to slip it into a glass of wine in a busy crowded bar.

I never ever ever leave my drink unattended or let a stranger buy me a drink without me being there, but it would be easy to slip it into a glass whereas almost impossible putting it into a bottle that someone is holding.<br><br>

Yeah that was what I was going to say too - she obviously drank so much water as an affect of the ecstacy, but then she also was not educated about taking them safely.  In some ways she should have researched this herself to ensure her own safety, but at the time the safety awareness was not around.<br><br>
These days it is, although I actually didn't know that drinking too mcuch water was bad - I thought it was encouraged as I've seen posters in Brunel reminding users to drink water to stay hydrated.<br><br>
